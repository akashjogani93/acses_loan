                            <p style="color:black;font-size:12pt;" class="wow slideInLeft">Accidents have a notorious tendency to strike when we are least expecting time. The surprise element of any accident is what makes it more lethal than the actual occurrence. If we knew what is to befall us in the near future, it is easier to provide for such an emergency but in case of an unannounced accident the analogy of a ‘deer caught in the headlights’ is more appropriate.
                                <br><br>
Accidents are unpredictable and can result in permanent disability, partial disablement or irreparable damage. Thus it is advisable for every individual to be insured with PERSONAL ACCIDENT INSURANCE policy. One of the benefits of the accident insurance policy is that any individual who is below the age of 65 yrs can avail this policy. The accident insurance cover is available for the entire family which not only includes the spouse and children but also dependent parents.
